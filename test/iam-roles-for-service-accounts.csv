Least privilege in IAM roles?,"Least privilege in IAM roles means that IAM permissions can be scoped to a service account, and only Pods that use that service account have access to those permissions."
Credential isolation in IAM roles?,Credential isolation in IAM roles means that a Pod's containers can only retrieve credentials for the IAM role that's associated with the service account that the container uses. A container never has access to credentials that are used by other containers in other Pods.
Auditability in IAM roles?,Auditability in IAM roles means that access and event logging is available through AWS CloudTrail to help ensure retrospective auditing.
