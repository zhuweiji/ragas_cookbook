Question: eks custom tags for pod identity

Question: tags precedence in eks pod identity
Answer: Tags added to the session through the sts:AssumeRole request take precedence in case of conflict. For example, if Amazon EKS adds a key eks-cluster-name and value my-cluster to the session when EKS assume the customer role, and you have also added an eks-cluster-name tag to the IAM role with value my-own-cluster, then the former takes precedence and the value for the eks-cluster-name tag will be my-cluster.
