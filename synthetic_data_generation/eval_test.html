      <td>What command displays an Accessible View in VS Code?</td>
      <td>The command to display an Accessible View in VS Code is "View: Open View" or "Toggle Screen Reader Accessibility Mode." The first command opens the view selection menu, and the second command enables or disables the screen reader optimized mode. The specific view for accessibility features is not mentioned in the provided context.</td>
      <td>[The Explorer view is only one of the views available in VS Code. There are also views for:  \n* **Search** - Provides global search and replace across your open folder.\n* **Source Control** - VS Code includes Git source control by default.\n* **Run** - VS Code's Run and Debug View displays variables, call stacks, and breakpoints.\n* **Extensions** - Install and manage your extensions within VS Code.\n* **Custom views** - Views contributed by extensions.  \n&gt; **Tip:** You can open any view using the **View: Open View** command.  \n![views](images/userinterface/views.png)  \nYou can show or hide views by right-clicking the Activity Bar, and reorder them by using drag and drop. Within the Explorer view, you can show or hide sections via the '...' menu, or drag and drop sections to reorder them.  \n![view management](images/userinterface/view-management.gif), When VS Code detects that a screen reader is being used, it goes into an optimized screen reader mode for UI such as the editor and Integrated Terminal. The Status bar will display **Screen Reader Optimized** in the lower right. You can exit screen reader mode by clicking on the display text or using the **Toggle Screen Reader Accessibility Mode** command.  \n![Activating the screen reader optimized status bar will show a notification that allows disabling the mode](images/accessibility/screen-reader-mode.png)  \nSome features, such as folding and minimap (code overview), are disabled when in screen reader mode. You can control whether VS Code uses screen reader mode with the **Editor: Accessibility Support** setting (`editor.accessibilitySupport`) and the values are `on`, `off`, or the default `auto` that automatically detects a screen reader through querying the platform., * [User Interface](/docs/getstarted/userinterface.md) - View the documentation for VS Code.\n* [Setup overview](/docs/setup/setup-overview.md) - Documentation for getting up and running with VS Code, including platform-specific setup., ---\nOrder: 22\nArea: editor\nTOCTitle: Accessibility\nContentId: 62894B41-CC33-400A-8A56-8C761C77B4C7\nPageTitle: Accessibility in Visual Studio Code\nDateApproved: 05/02/2024\nMetaDescription: Visual Studio Code user accessibility features.

This should typically not be needed as programs will often move the cursor instead of using the `kbstyle(Tab)` character, but may be useful in some situations., Terminal tabs appear on the right of the terminal view when there are two or more terminals by default, showing the active terminal in the view header when there is only one.  \n![A blank terminal without tabs and then with tabs displayed for three terminals](images/appearance/tabs.png), Terminal tabs can be dragged and dropped between VS Code windows. This can also be done manually through the Command Palette and the **Terminal: Detach Session** and **Terminal: Attach to Session** commands., Last release, we introduced automatic relaunching of terminals when an extension wants to change the environment. This release will now prevent the flickering that was caused before when the relaunch occurs. If the output of the new terminal is identical to the last, there is no feedback or distractions caused by the relaunch.  \nThere is also a new setting to disable this automatic relaunching all together `terminal.integrated.environmentChangesRelaunch`.]</td>

The color that you choose will highlight the respective error or warning. The colors shown in the preceding example, `#ffef0f` (yellow) and `#37777ff` (blue), are more accessible to individuals with common forms of color vision deficiencies., We've created a set of VS Code themes that closely resemble the default Light and Dark themes in Visual Studio, and include colors for semantic tokens.

      <td>The recommended color theme for people with deuteranopia is to use complementary colors, which can be found using a color blind simulator and interactive color wheel, such as the one provided by Adobe Color. The blog post discusses customizing the look of the Visual Studio Code editor, but it does not specify a particular color theme for people with deuteranopia. The post focuses on Color Themes, File Icon Themes, and other settings to change the look and feel of the code editor.</td>
      <td>[The accessibility of colors is subjective to the type of anomalous trichromacy (color blindness). The level of severity ranges per person and can be divided into four condition types:  \n|   Condition      |   Type    |\n|       ---        |    ---    |\n|   Deuteranopia   |   Reduced sensitivity to green light. It is the most common form of color blindness.\n|   Protanopia     |   Reduced sensitivity to red light.\n|   Tritanopia     |   Reduced sensitivity to blue light. This condition is considered rare.\n|   Monochromia    |   The inability to see all colors, also referred to as achromatopsia. More information about the rarest form of color blindness: [Foundation for Fighting Blindness](https://www.fightingblindness.org/diseases/achromatopsia).  \nOne of the best approaches to selecting the best colors for a specific condition is to apply complementary colors. These are colors located opposite of one another on a color wheel.  \n![Color wheel highlighting complementary colors for regular vision, deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia and monochromacy](images/accessibility/accessibility-color-wheels.png)  \n&gt;**Note**: For more information on finding complementary colors, access the color blind simulator and interactive color wheel at [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility)., As a part of the accessibility work, the **High Contrast** theme, which was only available for Windows users, is now enabled for all 3 platforms.  \n![High Contrast Theme](images/February/high-contrast.png), The previously proposed `backgroundColor` for the `StatusBarItem` API is now stable. Currently only `statusBarItem.errorBackground` is supported to avoid the Status bar looking too colorful. We may expand this support to more colors in the future.  \n![Status bar error in red](images/1_52/status-error.png)  \nThe use case for this new API is to enable extensions to indicate error conditions in the Status bar. For example, the ESLint extension may decide to use this color to alert the user that ESLint has not yet been enabled for a workspace., June 20, 2017 Wade Anderson, [@waderyan_](https://twitter.com/waderyan_)  \nHaving a great looking editor is a necessity for any full-time developer. We spend a lot of time in our editor and we like to keep things fresh and interesting!  \nVisual Studio Code supports a lot of customizations, in particular the look of your environment.
