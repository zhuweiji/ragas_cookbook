What is the recommended value for the namespace if you plan to deploy your sample application to AWS Fargate?,The recommended value for the namespace is `eks-sample-app`.
What kind of deployment does the sample application perform in Kubernetes?,"The sample application performs a Kubernetes deployment, pulling a container image from a public repository and deploying three replicas of it to your cluster."
What does the `kubernetes.io/os: linux` nodeSelector mean in the sample deployment?,The `kubernetes.io/os: linux` nodeSelector means that the image will only be deployed to Linux nodes if you have both Linux and Windows nodes in your cluster.
"What does the `kubernetes.io/arch: amd64`, `kubernetes.io/arch: arm64` values under the `kubernetes.io/arch` key mean in the sample deployment?","The `kubernetes.io/arch: amd64`, `kubernetes.io/arch: arm64` values mean that the application can be deployed to either AMD64 or ARM64 hardware architecture if you have both in your cluster."
What does the `kubernetes.io/os: windows` nodeSelector mean?,The `kubernetes.io/os: windows` nodeSelector means that the image will only be deployed to Windows nodes in the cluster.
What is the architecture specified in the nodeAffinity?,The architecture specified in the nodeAffinity is amd64.
What is the name of the container in the Windows deployment?,The name of the container in the Windows deployment is windows-server-iis.
What is the image used for the Windows container?,The image used for the Windows container is mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019.
What is the target port for the service in the Windows deployment?,The target port for the service in the Windows deployment is 80.
What resource maintains the number of replicas specified in the manifest?,"Kubernetes automatically creates and maintains the `ReplicaSet` resource, even though it isn't specified in the sample manifests."
What is the role of the `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler` and `Vertical Pod Autoscaler` in a production deployment?,"In a production deployment, the `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler` and `Vertical Pod Autoscaler` can be used to horizontally scale the number of replicas or vertically scale the compute resources for the Pods."
"Which command is used to run a shell on a Pod, replacing `65b7669776-m6qxz` with the Pod ID?
Answer:
- For Linux: `kubectl exec -it eks-sample-linux-deployment-65b7669776-m6qxz -n eks-sample-app -- /bin/bash`
- For Windows: `kubectl exec -it eks-sample-windows-deployment-65b7669776-m6qxz -n eks-sample-app -- powershell.exe`

Question: How can one view the DNS server for a Pod from the Pod shell on Linux?",The command to view the DNS server for a Pod from the Pod shell on Linux is not specified in the provided context.
What is the significance of the IP address assigned to a Pod in the output of `kubectl describe pod`?,The IP address assigned to a Pod in the output of `kubectl describe pod` is a unique IP assigned to the Pod from the CIDR block assigned to the subnet that the node is in. This IP address is used for communication within the Kubernetes cluster.
What is the DNS server for Pods in the cluster?,10.100.0.10
Which command displays the DNS server for the Windows Pod?,Get-NetIPConfiguration
"How can you remove the sample namespace, service, and deployment?",kubectl delete namespace eks-sample-app
What is the command used to exit the Pod?,exit
Which file contains the DNS server information in the Linux Pod?,/etc/resolv.conf
