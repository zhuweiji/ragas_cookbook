What should be ensured for existing nodes to communicate with Fargate Pods?,It should be ensured that any existing nodes in the cluster can send and receive traffic to and from the cluster security group.
How can the cluster security group be added to the nodes manually?,"The cluster security group can be added to the nodes manually by using the AWS Management Console under the Networking section for the cluster, or by using the AWS CLI command 'aws eks describe-cluster' to check for a security group for the cluster."
What is the purpose of creating a Fargate Pod execution role?,The purpose of creating a Fargate Pod execution role is to provide the IAM permissions for the components that run on the Fargate infrastructure to make calls to AWS APIs on your behalf.
What is required when creating a Fargate profile with 'eksctl'?,"When creating a Fargate profile with 'eksctl', a namespace must be specified, but the '--labels' option is not required."
What is the first step to create a Fargate profile?,The first step is to choose the Compute tab.
What is the requirement for subnets where Pods are running on Fargate?,Only private subnets are supported for Pods that are running on Fargate.
What is the purpose of the 'infrastructure: fargate' Kubernetes label?,The 'infrastructure: fargate' Kubernetes label is used to match Pods in a specified namespace that also have this label.
What command is used to remove the 'eks.amazonaws.com/compute-type : ec2' annotation from the CoreDNS Pods?,"The command is 'kubectl patch deployment coredns -n kube-system --type json -p='[{""op"": ""remove"", ""path"": ""/spec/template/metadata/annotations/eks.amazonaws.com~1compute-type""}]''."
What is the recommended autoscaling approach for Fargate Pods?,"It is recommended to use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler to set the initial correct size of CPU and memory, and then use the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale those Pods. If you want the Vertical Pod Autoscaler to automatically re-deploy Pods to Fargate with higher CPU and memory combinations, set the Vertical Pod Autoscaler's mode to either 'Auto' or 'Recreate'."
