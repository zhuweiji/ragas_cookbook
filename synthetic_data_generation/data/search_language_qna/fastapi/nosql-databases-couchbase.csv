Couchbase document structure,"In Couchbase, a document is a JSON object with keys and values, where values can also be other JSON objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, etc."
Couchbase Bucket function,"The `get_bucket` function connects to a Couchbase cluster, authenticates in the cluster, gets a Bucket instance, sets defaults for timeouts, and returns it."
Pydantic models in Couchbase,"Pydantic models can be used to represent Couchbase documents, with the `User` model representing the data returned in the path operation and the `UserInDB` model representing the data stored in the database."
Function to get user from username,"A dedicated function was created to get the user from a `username`, independent of the path operation function, for easier reuse and unit testing."
