fastapi sql databases?,"FastAPI supports the use of any relational database that is supported by SQLAlchemy, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server."
sqlalchemy orm?,"SQLAlchemy ORM is a tool that converts objects in code to database tables and is commonly used with FastAPI. It allows you to create a class that represents a table in a SQL database, and each instance of the class represents a row in the database."
sqlalchemy database url?,"The SQLAlchemy database URL specifies the location and credentials for the database. For example, in the case of a SQLite database, it is the location of the database file."
sqlalchemy engine?,The SQLAlchemy engine is used to connect to the database and perform operations. It is created using the SQLAlchemy database URL.
sqlite connect args?,"The `connect_args={""check_same_thread"": False}` argument is needed when using SQLite with FastAPI to allow multiple threads to communicate with the database. It is not needed for other databases."
What is the purpose of SessionLocal class?,"The SessionLocal class is used to create a database session instance for each request, ensuring each request gets its own database connection session."
What is the role of the Base class in SQLAlchemy models?,The Base class is used as a parent class for all the database models or classes (ORM models) in SQLAlchemy.
What is the purpose of the create_database function?,The create_database function is used to create the database tables and relationships based on the SQLAlchemy models.
What is the difference between SQLAlchemy models and Pydantic models?,"SQLAlchemy models are used to interact with the database, while Pydantic models define the valid data shape and are used for data validation, conversion, and documentation."
What is the purpose of the ItemCreate and UserCreate Pydantic models?,"The ItemCreate and UserCreate Pydantic models are used to have additional data attributes needed for creating new items and users, while ItemBase and UserBase are used for common attributes while creating or reading data."
What is the purpose of `orm_mode` in Pydantic models?,"The `orm_mode` in Pydantic models allows the model to read data even if it is not a dictionary, but an ORM model or any other arbitrary object with attributes. This makes the Pydantic model compatible with ORMs, enabling it to return a database model and read data from it."
How does SQLAlchemy handle lazy loading?,"SQLAlchemy follows a lazy loading approach, fetching data for relationships from the database only when the attribute containing that data is accessed. For example, accessing the `items` attribute would prompt SQLAlchemy to fetch data from the `items` table."
What are the benefits of creating utility functions for database interactions?,Creating dedicated functions for interacting with the database offers advantages such as easier reusability in multiple parts of the application and the ability to add unit tests for these functions.
What are the steps for creating data using SQLAlchemy models?,"The steps for creating data using SQLAlchemy models involve creating an instance of the model with your data, adding it to the database session, committing the changes to the database, and refreshing the instance to include any new data from the database, like the generated ID."
"When creating a SQLAlchemy model instance from a Pydantic model, what method should be used?","The `.dict()` method (or `.model_dump()` in Pydantic v2) should be used to generate a dictionary with the Pydantic model's data, and then the key-value pairs from this dictionary should be passed as keyword arguments to the SQLAlchemy model."
sqlalchemy model to dict,The `item.dict()` function converts the SQLAlchemy model to a Pydantic dict.
sqlalchemy model to db,Passing the `dict`'s key-value pairs as the keyword arguments to the SQLAlchemy `Item` creates a record from a Pydantic model.
fastapi db dependency,"A `SessionLocal` dependency is created to ensure an independent database session per request, using the same session through all the request and then closing it after the request is finished."
fastapi crud path ops,"FastAPI *path operations* are created by calling CRUD functions directly, using the database session obtained from the dependency."
sqlalchemy orm mode,"With the `orm_mode` enabled, the data declared in Pydantic models is extracted from the SQLAlchemy models and returned to the client, with all the normal filtering and validation."
sqlalchemy db connection,"The SQLAlchemy code inside the path operation function and in the dependency communicates with an external database. However, SQLAlchemy doesn't support using 'await' directly, so the path operation functions and the dependency should be declared without 'async def'."
use async sqlalchemy,"If you need to connect to the relational database asynchronously, see the Async SQL (Relational) Databases documentation for more information."
sqlalchemy alembic migrations,"Since SQLAlchemy is used directly and doesn't require any plugins, you can integrate database migrations with Alembic directly. The code related to SQLAlchemy and models lives in separate files, allowing you to perform migrations with Alembic without FastAPI or Pydantic."
sqlalchemy project structure,"The project should have a directory named 'my_super_project' that contains a sub-directory called 'sql_app'. The 'sql_app' directory should have several files, including 'database.py', 'models.py', 'schemas.py', 'crud.py', and 'main.py'. These files handle database connection, model definitions, schema definitions, CRUD operations, and the main application, respectively."
sqlalchemy db explorer,"To explore the SQLite database file directly, you can use DB Browser for SQLite, SQLite Viewer, or ExtendsClass. These tools allow you to debug the database contents, add tables, columns, records, modify data, and more."
What is a `SessionLocal()` creation and handling in try block?,"The creation of the `SessionLocal()` and handling of the requests are placed in a `try` block to ensure the database session is always closed after the request, even if there was an exception while processing the request."
What is the purpose of `request.state`?,"`request.state` is a property of each `Request` object used to store arbitrary objects attached to the request, like the database session in this case. It helps ensure a single database session is used through all the request and then closed afterwards (in the middleware)."
How does middleware compare to dependencies with `yield`?,"Middleware requires more code, is more complex, and the function has to be `async`. It runs for every request, which could lead to performance issues if there's a lot of I/O waiting. Dependencies with `yield` are probably better for use cases where they're enough, as they were added recently to FastAPI."
What happens when using middleware for database session management?,"When using middleware for database session management, a connection is created for every request, even when the path operation that handles that request didn't need the DB. This could potentially lead to performance issues."
When were dependencies with `yield` added to FastAPI?,"Dependencies with `yield` were added recently to FastAPI. A previous version of the tutorial only had examples with a middleware for database session management, and there are probably several applications using the middleware for this purpose."
