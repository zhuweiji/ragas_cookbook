What is CORS?,"CORS or ""Cross-Origin Resource Sharing"" refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different ""origin"" than the frontend."
What is origin?,"An origin is the combination of protocol (`http`, `https`), domain (`myapp.com`, `localhost`, `localhost.tiangolo.com`), and port (`80`, `443`, `8080`)."
What are allowed origins?,"The backend must have a list of ""allowed origins"" to allow the JavaScript in the frontend send its request to the backend."
What is CORSMiddleware?,You can configure CORS in your FastAPI application using the CORSMiddleware.
When to use wildcards?,"It's also possible to declare the list as `""*""` (a ""wildcard"") to say that all are allowed, but that will only allow certain types of communication, excluding everything that involves credentials."
