# Common use cases in Amazon EKS<a name="common-use-cases"></a>

Amazon EKS offers robust managed Kubernetes services on AWS, designed to optimize containerized applications\. The following are a few of the most common use cases of Amazon EKS, helping you leverage its strengths for your specific needs\.

**Deploying high\-availability applications**  
Using [Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), you can make sure that your applications are highly available across multiple [Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)\.

**Building microservices architectures**  
Use Kubernetes service discovery features with [AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/) or [Amazon VPC Lattice](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/lattice/) to build resilient systems\.

**Automating software release process**  
Manage continuous integration and continuous deployment \(CICD\) pipelines that simplify the process of automated building, testing, and deployment of applications\.

**Running serverless applications**  
Use [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) with Amazon EKS to run serverless applications\. This means you can focus solely on application development, while Amazon EKS and Fargate handle the underlying infrastructure\.

**Executing machine learning workloads**  
Amazon EKS is compatible with popular machine learning frameworks such as [https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [https://mxnet.apache.org/](https://mxnet.apache.org/), and [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)\. With GPU support, you can handle even complex machine learning tasks effectively\.

**Deploying consistently on premises and in the cloud**  
Use [Amazon EKS Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/) to operate Kubernetes clusters on your own infrastructure using tools that are consistent with Amazon EKS in the cloud\.

**Running cost\-effective batch processing and big data workloads**  
Utilize [Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) to run your batch processing and big data workloads such as [https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/hadoop/what-is-hadoop/](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/hadoop/what-is-hadoop/) and [https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/what-is-spark/](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/what-is-spark/), at a fraction of the cost\. This lets you take advantage of unused Amazon EC2 capacity at discounted prices\.

**Securing application and ensuring compliance**  
Implement strong security practices and maintain compliance with Amazon EKS, which integrates with AWS security services such as [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) \(IAM\), [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) \(Amazon VPC\), and [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) \(AWS KMS\)\. This ensures data privacy and protection as per industry standards\.
