# Amazon EKS add\-on support for ADOT Operator<a name="opentelemetry"></a>

Amazon EKS supports using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI and Amazon EKS API to install and manage the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry \(ADOT\)](https://aws-otel.github.io/) Operator\. This makes it easier to enable your applications running on Amazon EKS to send metric and trace data to multiple monitoring service options like [Amazon CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch), [https://console.aws.amazon.com/prometheus](https://console.aws.amazon.com/prometheus), and [X\-Ray](https://console.aws.amazon.com/xray)\.

For more information, see [Getting Started with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry using EKS Add\-Ons](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/adot-eks-add-on) in the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry documentation\.
