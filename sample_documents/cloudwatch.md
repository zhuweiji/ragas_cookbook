# Amazon EKS add\-on support for Amazon CloudWatch<a name="cloudwatch"></a>

Amazon CloudWatch Observability collects real\-time logs, metrics, and trace data\. It sends them to [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) and [AWS X\-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html)\. You can install this add\-on to enable both CloudWatch Application Signals and CloudWatch Container Insights with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS\. This helps you monitor the health and performance of your infrastructure and containerized applications\. The Amazon CloudWatch Observability Operator is designed to install and configure the necessary components\.

Amazon EKS supports Amazon CloudWatch Observability Operator as an [Amazon EKS add\-on](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-add-ons.html)\. The add\-on allows Container Insights on both Linux and Windows worker nodes in the cluster\. To enable Container Insights on Windows, the Amazon EKS add\-on version must be `1.5.0` or higher\. Currently, CloudWatch Application Signals isnâ€™t supported on Amazon EKS Windows\.
